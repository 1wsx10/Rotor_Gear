# do stuff with landing gear on rotors

1. put a landing gear on a rotor
2. put any timers you want triggered also on that rotor
3. put the program in a programmable block and compile it (the setup runs when the program is compiled, so if you change stuff, you need to recompile)

### Timer Settings
you can put the following in the name of your timer to run it when the landing gear locks/unlocks

```
lock:start
lock:trigger
unlock:start
unlock:trigger
```
